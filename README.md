# JetiVarioGPS
Jeti multi sensor, using a MS5611 pressure sensor for vario function,
GPS and more sensors for Jeti RC control, based on code by nightflyer88 (see cloned repository) and on the JetiExBus libraries by Bernd Wokoeck. This code is for a Teensy 3.5 board and an Eclipse IDE. Code was adapted to my purposes.
